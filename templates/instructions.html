    <h2>General Instructions</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the ECON 3310 Experiment Platform.</p>
    <p>You will participate in <strong>10 rounds</strong> of simple decision problems. Each round should take about 1 minute or less.</p>
    <p>Before the experiment begins, we randomly pick an integer in 1..10, called <strong>R</strong>. You won’t see it until the end. Your total points = your <strong>WEALTH</strong> in round R.</p>
    <p>In each round you start with 100 points. Choose how much (<em>x</em>) to invest in a risky asset (0–100). A fair coin is flipped: Heads → the investment becomes 2.5x; Tails → it becomes 0. Your wealth that round is <strong>100 − x + 2.5x</strong> (heads) or <strong>100 − x</strong> (tails).</p>
